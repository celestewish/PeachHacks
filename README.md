 ## About
 This is a game called Mobatchi we worked on for PeachHacks Hackathon. It is a combination of a MOBA and a Virtual Pet care game.

 ## How To Play
 In the virtual pet sequence, use the mouse to click and drag resources to your pet. In the fighting sequence, click on the ground to guide your pet to specific locations. To use your basic attack, simply walk up to enemies and your pet will automatically attack them till they are dead. To use your basic ability, press one. To use your ultimate ability, press two. The boss can only be killed with an ultimate.
